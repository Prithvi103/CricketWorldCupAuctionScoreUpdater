# Cricket World Cup Auction Score Updater


Wrote a script to read cricket match scores daily from msn.com and update scores based on performance of the player. I used google sheets API to update the score on google sheets. Please use your own credentials. You can view the sheets I uploaded by using the sheets ID mentioned in the code. Just run test.py. I run the job daily to check if the matches at the top have been completed and then delete the matches from the all games list if I have written the scores.
